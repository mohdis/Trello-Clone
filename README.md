# Trello-Clone

https://trello-clone-black.vercel.app/

It's nice and neat app(Trello clone) that has been developed by me in order to practice using vanilla js to make frontend projects.
What i used in this project:

- Parcel for bundling
- Sass as preprocessor for css
- Eslint and Prettier for linting and formating
- And the most important one: Vanilla JS

Features of this project:

- Add new task to each list
- Edit previous added tasks
- Remove previous added tasks
- Search for tasks
- Move tasks from one list to another by Drag and Drop
- Responsive for all devices
